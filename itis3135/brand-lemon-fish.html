        is an unceasing nightmare and we can't wake up. Our company will always
        be here for you, though. As long as crossroads exist in the world, we
        will have an open office and complimentary coffee. We've been providing
        quality immortality to the human race since it's cursed secret was first
        discovered.

          Milk and blood both spontaneously boil when in the presence of our
