        Time is all relative based on age and experience. When you are a child
        an hour is a long time to wait but a very short time when that’s all the
        time you are allowed watching
      </p>

      <p style="width: 50%; margin: auto">
        TV. As a teenager time goes faster the more deadlines you have and the
        more you procrastinate. As a young adult, you think you have forever to
        live and don’t appreciate the time you spend with others. As a
        middle-aged adult, time flies by as you watch your children grow up. And
        finally, as you get old and you have fewer responsibilities and fewer
        demands on you, time slows. You appreciate each day and are thankful you
        are alive. An hour is the same amount of time for everyone yet it can
        feel so different in how it goes by.

        According to the caption on the bronze marker placed by the Multnomah
        Chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution on May 12, 1939,
        “College Hall (is) the oldest building in continuous use for Educational
        purposes west of the Rocky Mountains. Here were educated men and women
        who have won recognition throughout the world in all the learned
        professions.”
