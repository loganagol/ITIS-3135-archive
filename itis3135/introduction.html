          <b>Personal Background:</b> <br />
          I love weird fiction, doom metal, power metal, indie music, lifting
          weights, running, walking, animation, painting, and architecture. Some
          of my favorite books are "Stories of Your Life and Others",
          "Jagannath", and "100 Years of Solitude".
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Professional Background:</b> <br />
          Odd jobs and some IT work. Looking for a career in Utah, preferably
          working in security, logistics, or government.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Academic Background:</b> <br />
          I'm a senior in Computer Science with a concentration in Software,
          Systems, and Networks. Although I'm practically following the
          cybersecurity route.

          <b>Background in this Subject:</b> <br />
          I remember taking a course similar to this way back in high school,
          but that was a long time ago.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Primary Computer Platform:</b> <br />
          I'm a big fan of Linux and use Ubuntu as my main OS.

          <b>Courses I'm Taking & Why</b>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>ITIS-3135</b> Web Application Design and Development: <br />
              Prerequisite for some later cybersecurity courses.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>ITIS-3200</b> Introduction to Information Security and Privacy:
              <br />
              Professor came highly recommended and it filled an elective slot
              for two different concentrations.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>ITSC-3146</b> Intro to Operating Systems and Networking: <br />
              Required course. Plus, I took 3181 last semester and liked it, and
              I heard 3146 is similar stuff.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>ITSC-3155</b> Software Engineering: <br />
              Required course. At least I'll finally get to use git in class.
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>STAT-2122</b> Intro to Probability and Statistics: <br />
              The math gods decided they weren't done with me yet.

        </li>
        <li>
          <b>For Your Amusement:</b> <br />
          Justice is best served cold. Otherwise, it would be justwater.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>I'd also like to share:</b> <br />
          I'm from North Carolina. It's the best Carolina, trust me.
