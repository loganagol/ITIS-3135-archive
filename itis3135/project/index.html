            Jubilee is a 6 year old German Wirehaired Pointer. She enjoys
            participating in a variety of dog sports, including obedience,
            rally, hunt tests, dock diving, lure coursing and barn hunt.
          </p>
          <p>
            She is a witty girl who in her free time enjoys using skills she has
            learned to amuse herself. She frequently greets guests with a shoe,
            or a choice piece of dirty laundry lovingly plucked from the hamper.
            She is a sassy dog with a lot of opinions and doesn't hesitate to
            make herself heard.

            Newt is a 1 1/2 year old German Wirehaired Pointer. He's still a
            newbie to the dog sports game but he's already dipped his paw into
            quite a few different games and earned a number of introductory
            titles. He has competed (or soon will) in conformation, obedience,
            rally, agility, hunt tests, field trials, dock diving, lure
            coursing, and barn hunt.
          </p>
          <p>
            He is a sweet, cuddly boy with a heart of gold. He's a bit of a
            wimp, but what coddled mama's boy isn't? He shows a lot of promise
            and has a bright future ahead of him as a dog sport competitor.
