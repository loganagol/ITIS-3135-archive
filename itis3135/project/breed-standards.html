      <h2>About German Wirehair Pointers</h2>
    </main>

    <p>
      German wirehaired pointers are medium to large pointing dogs bred in
      Germany starting in the 19th century. They are versatile hunting dogs that
      are capable of both pointing and retrieving game. They are truly
      multipurpose hunters, capable of working with upland game, waterfowl,
      tracking wounded game, and as a gundog. They are also known as the
      <em>Deutsch Drahthaar</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their most distinctive features are their stocky build, wiry and
      weatherproof coat, and full beard. These features make them hardy field
      dogs resistant to wind, rain, and sharp underbrush. They are intelligent
      and adaptable dogs who excel in a wide range of environments.

      <li>
        General Appearance:<br />
        The German Wirehaired Pointer is a well muscled, medium sized dog of
        distinctive appearance. Balanced in size and sturdily built, the breed’s
        most distinguishing characteristics are its weather resistant, wire-like
        coat and its facial furnishings. Typically Pointer in character and
        style, the German Wirehaired Pointer is an intelligent, energetic and
        determined hunter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Size: <br />
        The height of males should be from 24 to 26 inches at the withers.
        Bitches are smaller but not under 22 inches. The German Wirehaired
        Pointer is a versatile hunter built for agility and endurance in the
        field. Correct size and balance are essential to high performance.
      </li>
      <li>
        Coat: <br />
        The functional wiry coat is the breed’s most distinctive feature. The
        coat is weather resistant and, to some extent, water-repellent. The
        undercoat is dense enough in winter to insulate against the cold but is
        so thin in summer as to be almost invisible. The outer coat is long
        enough to protect against the punishment of rough cover, but not so long
        as to hide the outline of the dog. Eyebrows are of strong, straight
        hair. Beard and whiskers are medium length.
      </li>
      <li>
        Color:<br />
        The coat is liver and white, usually either liver and white spotted,
        liver roan, liver and white spotted with ticking and roaning or solid
        liver. The head is liver, sometimes with a white blaze. The ears are
        liver.
      </li>
      <li>
        Temperment:<br />
        Of sound, reliable temperament, the German Wirehaired Pointer is at
        times aloof but not unfriendly toward strangers; a loyal and
        affectionate companion who is eager to please and enthusiastic to learn.
      </li>
