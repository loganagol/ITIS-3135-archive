        General Appearance:<br />
        The German Wirehaired Pointer is a well muscled, medium sized dog of
        distinctive appearance. Balanced in size and sturdily built, the breed’s
        most distinguishing characteristics are its weather resistant, wire-like
        coat and its facial furnishings. Typically Pointer in character and
        style, the German Wirehaired Pointer is an intelligent, energetic and
        determined hunter.

        Size: <br />
        The height of males should be from 24 to 26 inches at the withers.
        Bitches are smaller but not under 22 inches. To insure the working
        quality of the breed is maintained, dogs that are either over or under
        the specified height must be severely penalized. The body is a little
        longer than it is high, as ten is to nine. The German Wirehaired Pointer
        is a versatile hunter built for agility and endurance in the field.
        Correct size and balance are essential to high performance.

        Coat: <br />
        The functional wiry coat is the breed’s most distinctive feature. A dog
        must have a correct coat to be of correct type. The coat is weather
        resistant and, to some extent, water-repellent. The undercoat is dense
        enough in winter to insulate against the cold but is so thin in summer
        as to be almost invisible. The distinctive outer coat is straight,
        harsh, wiry and flat lying, and is from one to two inches in length. The
        outer coat is long enough to protect against the punishment of rough
        cover, but not so long as to hide the outline of the dog. On the lower
        legs the coat is shorter and between the toes it is of softer texture.
        On the skull the coat is naturally short and close fitting. Over the
        shoulders and around the tail it is very dense and heavy. The tail is
        nicely coated, particularly on the underside, but devoid of feather.
        Eyebrows are of strong, straight hair. Beard Page 2 of 2 and whiskers
        are medium length.
      </li>
      <li>
        Color:<br />
        The coat is liver and white, usually either liver and white spotted,
        liver roan, liver and white spotted with ticking and roaning or solid
        liver. The head is liver, sometimes with a white blaze. The ears are
        liver. Any black in the coat is to be severely penalized.
      </li>
      <li>
        Temperment:<br />
        Of sound, reliable temperament, the German Wirehaired Pointer is at
        times aloof but not unfriendly toward strangers; a loyal and
        affectionate companion who is eager to please and enthusiastic to learn.
