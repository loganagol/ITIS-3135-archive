          >Mandiant Security Blog</a
        >
        <p>
          This website is the public blog for Mandiant, a cybersecurity company.
          The blog contains updates on company products, efforts, security
          threats, and incident response writeups.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Contrast:<br />
            The contrast of the website is good, relying on darkness and
            brightness with minimal color. The small amounts of color that are
            used are bright red, used for emphasis. The color choice pops
            against both white and black backgrounds equally well. Contrast is
            also shown in the text sizes, which clearly delineate titles and
            content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repetition:<br />
            The repetition is also good. There are a large number of blog posts
            on each page, but each one has a uniform format (color, size, and
            content). There are a lot of posts on the screen but regular
            formatting and use of a limited color palette prevent it becoming
            overwhelming.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alignment:<br />
            Alignment is used here to separate the other page content from the
            blogposts. It's also used to show the difference between the title
            and information of each blog post.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proximity:<br />
            Proximity is extremely important when there are many different items
            in one place, and the designers here realize that. Each post is
            separated from another by both margin and spacing between titles.
            The main page content is also separated from the blog posts by lack
            of proximity. Whereas blog post information is kept very close to
            the titles.
          </li>
        </ul>

      <section>
        <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/">Hacker News</a>
        <p>
          Hacker News is a user-submitted content aggregation site similar to
          Reddit. It predominately caters to more technologically-inclined
          users. Users submit links to interesting sites, upvote others posts,
          and comment with deeply nested replies.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Contrast:<br />
            The only real colors used are black, white, and orange, but the
            orange is only used to emphasize the title bar at the top. There is
            also very little size contrast between different elements. UI
            elements and content are largely identical in size and color.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repetition:<br />
            There are 30 posts per page, and in this case the repetition makes
            it hard to read. Every element looks like a repeat of the last, and
            the large numbers of similar posts blur together.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alignment:<br />
            The alignment isn't terrible, but it could be better. Post
            information is jumbled together at the left under each entry, and
            the top header bar is aligned with the posts. However, at least the
            footer is center aligned, which helps it stand out from the page
            content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proximity:<br />
            The page content is far too close together. The post points, title,
            information, and link are also too close together. There are small
            margins on the left and the right, but the nav bard, header, footer,
            and content could really use larger margins or padding. Especially
            between the posts.
