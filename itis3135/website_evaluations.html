        <p>
          This website is a the public blog for Mandiant, a cybersecurity
          company. The blog contains updates on company products, efforts,
          security threats, and incident response writeups.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Contrast:<br />
            The contrast of the website is good, relying on darkness and
            brightness with minimal color. The small amounts of color that are
            used are bright red, used for emphasis. The color choice pops
            against both white and black backgrounds equally well. Contrast is
            also shown in the text sizes, which clearly delineate titles and
            content.
          </li>
          <li>
            Repetition:<br />
            The repetition is also good. There are a large number of blog posts
            on each page, but each one has a uniform format (color, size, and
            content). There are a lot of posts on the screen but regular
            formatting and use of a limited color palette prevent it becoming
            overwhelming.
          </li>
          <li>
            Alignment:<br />
            Alignment is used here to separate the other page content from the
            blogposts. It's also used to show the difference between the title
            and information of each blog post.
          </li>
          <li>
            Proximity:<br />
            Proximity is extremely important when there are many different items
            in one place, and the designers here realize that. Each post is
            separated from another by both margin and spacing between titles.
            The main page content is also separated from the blog posts by lack
            of proximity. Whereas blog post information is kept very close to
            the titles.
